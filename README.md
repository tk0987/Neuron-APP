# APP - Advanced Perceptron Project
ML tool for various tasks - to be continued

the goal is to script, not compile and still have good results + inference. along with to learn something new

# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Perceptron much more biological neuron-like than perceptrons in current use. Within one graph node several networks are connected interacting with each other - within built-in strict rules. And yes...

###One neuron from this project CAN be XOR gate.

Imagine, that you have just a small python board in application that process sensor data into project response. For example - autonomic vechicle. This ML tool should learn when to turn - without supervision of user.
It should be also light for very low inference times on uC. 

Just script, as you dont need binaries here or 'lite' versions of libraries (eg. tensorflow)

here is a trial - still under developement, but first results are promising.


please note, that network complexity can be very high.

One can make many networks in one code, and this networks could act independently - like fpga

# todo:

1. save current state as binary file for future use
